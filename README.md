# Canvas Work Sample

This repo houses working files for a [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/canvas) course work sample, created to accompany an application with [Instructure](https://www.instructure.com/) as an instructional designer. Canvas allows content creation using a subset of HTML and inline CSS styling based on the limitations of the [Canvas HTML Editor Allowlist](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Resource-Documents/Canvas-HTML-Editor-Allowlist/ta-p/387066). 

The sample course teaches the best practices for building a Canvas course, based on Instructure's [Course Evaluation Checklist v2.0](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Instructional-Designer/Course-Evaluation-Checklist-v2-0/ba-p/2803490).
