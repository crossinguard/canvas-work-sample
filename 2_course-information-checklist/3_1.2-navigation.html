    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <code><strong>1.2 | Course Navigation</strong> is clear and consistent (unused items are hidden). <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/engagement/recruiting-interest/threats-distractions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDL7.3</a></code>
    <p>Student familiarity with an learning management system (LMS) like Canvas varies greatly. Removing unused navigation elements and ensuring what remains is clear and consistent creates a more user-friendly experience. The navigation informs on the course content and navigation elements going to unused areas are akin to dead links.</p>
    <p>Effective navigation reduces cognitive load with an intuitive flow of information and efficient access to content materials and resources.</p>
    <h3>What Does It Look Like?</h3>
    <p>Canvas provides system navigation (e.g., Home, Announcements, Assignments, Discussions) with many turned on by default. While Canvas will automatically hide many unused system navigation elements, others like "Google Drive" will populate even if not utilized by the instructor.</p>
    <h3>How Do I Update It?</h3>
    <p>Within a course, select the bottom system navigation element "Settings". Inside you will see tabbed pages of settings to adjust. The third tab "Navigation" provides a drag-and-drop interface for adding, removing, or hiding system navigation elements.</p>
