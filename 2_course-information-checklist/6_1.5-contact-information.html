    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To explore the fifth item of Course Information regarding <strong>contact information</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
  <code><strong>1.5 | Contact information</strong> is provided, including communication preferences and response time expectations, with an optional biography or picture. <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/engagement/effort-persistence/collaboration-community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDL8.3</a></code>
  <p>Detailed instructor information and communication preferences fosters an open, transparent learning environment where students clearly understand and can adapt to expectations. Streamlining out-of-class or asynchronous interactions benefits all parties while maintaining a health boundary between work and life.</p>
  <h3>What Does It Look Like?</h3>
  <h4>Teacher Bio</h4>
  <p>Share a photo and lower the barrier to communication by including relevant and interesting tidbits about your journey. You know you are a human and not a knowledge robot, but do they?</p>
  <h4>Manage Expectations</h4>
  <p>Clearly outline availability expecations and typical response times to help students understand norms and plan accordingly. Students won't expect 24/7 access if boundaries are well defined and in place.</p>
  <h4>Provide Options</h4>
  <p>One method of communication rarely covers all needs. Investigate available tools of your institution and built-in Canvas tools to create a pallete of contact options to present to students. Don't forget to check that inbox!</p>
