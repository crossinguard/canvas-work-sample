  <h2>Home/Front Page</h2>
  <code><strong>1.1 | Home Page</strong> provides a visual representation of course; a brief course description or introduction; clear instructions for students (e.g., where to begin) and quick and easy navigation to current content. <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org/representation/language-symbols/illustrate-multimedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDL2.5</a></code>
  <p>In Canvas, the "home page" (or "front page") welcomes students into a course and provides onboarding information. In the traditional classroom, a home page can be equated to the first day of school. If successful, students should have a high level understanding of the course (e.g., overview of course structure, key components, content organization) and be ready to begin their learning journey. A home page represents common information that any student entering the course would benefit from knowing prior to beginning content lessons.</p>
  <h3>What Does It Look Like?</h3>
  <h4>Course Banner</h4>
  <p>A course banner can provide a visually appealing element that reflects the content or a desired theme for the course. A banner provides great opportunity for creativity by incorporating relevant images, icons, or a course logo. Think like a designer and create some branding for your course!</p>
  <h4>Course Title and Code</h4>
  <p>As a classroom teacher I ensured my name, room number, and the course name were visually front and center when students entered for the first time. Having been the "I am sitting in the wrong classroom and have been for 30 minutes" student, I always appreciated self-service knowledge. Making essential information easy to access removes information hurdles that may be entirely unreleated to the course content.</p>
  <h4>Welcome Message</h4>
  <p>Foster a personal connection with the students by writing a brief and welcoming introduction message from their new instructor.</p>
  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <p>Provide clear instructions on how students get started. This could be a text-based guide, an embedded video, or an infographic to enhance clarity. This provides a great resource for future students that enter class after initial onboarding (or just need a reminder!).</p>
  <h4>Important Dates</h4>
  <p>Highlight key dates associated with the course, such as crucial assignment deadlines, exam dates, or other time-sensitive information. This can help students better plan for when life gets in the way of a well structured schedule.</p>
  <h4>Feedback Mechanism</h4>
  <p>Improvement is as important for instructors as it is for students. Encourage an environment of shared growth by providing an easily located designated area for students to provide feedback on the course structure, content, or any concerns.</p>
  <h4>And More!</h4>
  <p>These are just a few suggestions. While any item covered in the <strong>Course Information</strong> focus area would be a great element to include on a home page, the home page can serve whatever elements will best serve students. This list is neither exhausive nor one-size-fits-all. Adapt to your students, anticipate needs, and iterate on ideas each cohort.</p>
