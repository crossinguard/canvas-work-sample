    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>In this module we explored the first focus area <strong>Course Information</strong> from the <a class="external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c6cv_95IT2MpYn2oy9HhNFnvJdODWsAqv3ovqtfSITc/template/preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Course Evaluation Checklist v2.0</span></a>. Many of these items would make great additions to a course home page (front page) and provide essential information for students to find success long before content enters the discussion.</p>
    <p>An intentionally designed Canvas course is anchored by complete, transparent course information that clarifies expectations, aligns to objectives, and supports learner success - all while reflecting instructor investment and institutional connectivity.</p>
    <p>The Course Home Page sets the tone through visual appeal and easy access to critical components. An inviting image paired with logical, uncluttered navigation immediately builds student confidence to explore course content.</p>
    <p>Prominently posting learning Goals & Objectives grounds all course activities in shared outcomes while enabling learner self-monitoring. Students appreciate understanding precisely how assignments and assessments build required knowledge and competencies.</p>
    <p>Clear Expectations, Conduct Standards, Grading Policies, and Makeup Protocols distribute responsibility by codifying penalties for violations as well as procedures for exemptions. Students can strategically manage workloads and deadlines knowing these policies.</p>
    <p>Instructor Contact Information, including availability, response times and a professional profile personalizes support expectations. Students reach out to instructors after gauging when and how to initiate queries based on transparent norms.</p>
    <p>Likewise, links to Institutional Resources reveal how the course connects to larger learning ecosystems including libraries, accessibility services, IT help desks, and advising networks. Students tap customized support based on course and personal needs.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, thoroughly outlining these course information components differentiates disorganized, unsupportive learning environments from thoughtfully designed Canvas courses where intentional design decisions demystify processes while demonstrating the instructor's learner-centered values through transparency, support, and clarity of expectations. This shift is proven to promote engagement, accountability, and student success rates.</p>
