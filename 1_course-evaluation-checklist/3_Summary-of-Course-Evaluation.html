A successful digital learning environment should use thoughtful design to ensure course materials are approachable by students of all backgrounds.</p>
    <p>Items within the checklist correspond to four areas of focus: <strong>Course Information</strong>, <strong>Course Content</strong>, <strong>Assessment of Student Learning</strong>, and <strong>Course Accessibility</strong>. Future modules will explore each of these focus areas, providing insight, examples, and opportunities to engage with other educators on their implementation.</p>
